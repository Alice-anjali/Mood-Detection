Billy Squier,In The Dark,"Life isn't easy from the singular side
Down in the hole some emotions are hard to hide
It's your decision, it's the chance that you take
It's on your head, it's a habit that's hard to break
Do you need a friend, would you tell no lies
Would you take me in, are you lonely in the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
You never listen to the voices inside
They fill your ears as you run to a place to hide
You're never sure if the illusion is real
You pinch yourself but the memories are all you feel
Can you break away from your alibies
Can you make a play, will you meet me in the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark, ah ah ah
Don'tcha need me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me, oh yea
Don'tcha need me, hey, hey
Don'tcha need me, oh yea
You take no interest, no opinion's to dear
You make the rounds and you try to be so sincere
You guard your hopes and you pocket your dreams
You'd trade it all to avoid an unpleasant scene
Can you face the fire when you see me there
Can you feel the fire, will you love me in the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark, ah ah ah ah",sad
Pink Floyd,One Of These Days,"One of these days, the ground will drop out from beneath your feet
One of these days, your heart will stop and play it's final beat

One of these days, the clocks will stop and time won't mean a thing
One of these days, their bombs will drop and silence everything

But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet, one of these days
I bet your heart 'll be broken
I bet your pride 'll be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet
One of these days, one of these days

One of these days, your eyes will close and pain will disappear
One of these days, you will forget to hope and learn to fear

But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright
Easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet, one of these days
I bet your heart 'll be broken
I bet your pride 'll be stolen

But it's alright, yeah it's alright, said it's alright
Yeah it's alright
Don't say it's alright, don't say it's alright
Don't say it's alright
One of these days your heart will stop and play it's final beat

But it's alright, easy for you to say
Your heart has never been broken
Your pride has never been stolen
Not yet, not yet, one of these days
I bet your heart will be broken
I bet your pride will be stolen
I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet, I'll bet

Not the type to mess around with her emotion
But the feeling that I have for you is so strong
Been together so long and this could never be wrong

Annie Lennox,Walking On Broken Glass,"Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

You were the sweetest thing that I ever knew
But I don't care for sugar, honey, if I can't have you
Since you've abandoned me
My whole life has crashed
Won't you pick the pieces up
'Cause it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass

The sun's still shining in big blue sky
But it don't mean nothing to me
Oh, let the rain come down
Let the wind blow through me
I'm living in an empty room
With all the windows smashed
And I've got so little left to lose
That it feels just like I'm walking on broken glass

And if you're trying to cut me down
You know that I might bleed
'Cause if you're trying to cut me down
I know that you'll succeed
And if you want to hurt me
There's nothing left to fear
'Cause if you want to hurt me
You're doing really well, my dear

Now everyone of us was made to suffer
Everyone of us was made to weep
We've been hurting one another
Now the pain has cut too deep
So take me from the wreckage
Save me from the blast
Lift me up and take me back
Don't let me keep on walking
I can't keep on walking, keep on walking on broken glass

Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass
Walking on, walking on broken glass

Soft Cell,Tainted Love,"Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away from the pain you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love

Now I know I've got to
Run away, I've got to
Get away, you don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry, I don't pray that way

Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love

Don't touch me, please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm gonna pack my things and go

Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)
Tainted love (oh)

Touch me, baby, tainted love
Touch me, baby, tainted love

Lenny Kravitz,Again,"I been searching for you
I heard a cry within my soul
I never had a yearning quite like this before
Now that you are walking right through my door
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
A sacred gift of heaven
For better worse, wherever
And I would never let somebody break you down
Until you cried, never
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
At every time I've always known
That you where there, upon your throne
A lonely queen without her king
I longed for you, my love forever
All of my life
Where have you been
I wonder if I'll ever see you again
And if that day comes
I know we could win
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

Cyndi Lauper,Time After Time,"Lying in my bed I hear the clock tick,
And think of you
Caught up in circles confusion--
Is nothing new
Flashback--warm nights--
Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories,
Time after--
Sometimes you picture me--
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear
What you've said--
Then you say--go slow--
I fall behind--
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows--you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time--
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Time after time
You said go slow--
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds--
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting

That hangs above my world
And I find myself wandering in the rain
And now I can't go on

'Cause I am lost

Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams
Afraid of what life really means
Living without your love

I need her guiding light
To shine on my darkest days
I was young, and time was on my side
But like a fool I let it slip away
And now those days are gone

And I am lost
Living inside myself
Living inside this shell
Living outside your love
I am lost
Somewhere inside my own dreams

Why should I mind, why should I mind
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway
What is Love anyway, does anybody love anybody anyway
Can anybody love anyone so much that they will never fear
Never worry never be sad
The answer is they cannot love this much nobody can
This is why I don't mind you doubting
And maybe love is letting people be just what they want to be
The door always must be left unlocked
To love when circumstance may lead someone away from you
And not to spend the time just doubting",happy

Kenny Loggins,Danger Zone,"Revvin' up your engine
Listen to her howlin' roar
Metal under tension
Beggin' you to touch and go
Highway to the danger zone
Ride into the danger zone
Headin' into twilight
Spreadin' out her wings tonight
She got you jumpin' off the track
And shovin' into overdrive
Highway to the danger zone
I'll take you
Ridin' into the danger zone
You'll never say hello to you
Until you get it on the red line overload
You'll never know what you can do
Until you get it up as high as you can go
Out along the edges
Always where I burn to be
The further on the edge
The hotter the intensity
Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you
Right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Gonna take you right into the danger zone
Highway to the danger zone
Right into the danger zone",angry
Eddie Money,Think I'm In Love,"Ooh, somethin's got a hold on me now
It's a feelin', burnin' like a lover on fire
Hold me tight, baby
Don't leave me by myself tonight
'Cause I don't think I can make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

It surrounds me
Over me like a sea of madness
It controls me
Makes me do all the things I do for you
You're on my mind, babe
Thinkin' about you now
And I don't know if I'll make it through the night

I think I'm in love
And my life's lookin' up
I think I'm in love
'Cause I can't get enough (no, no, no)
I think I'm in love
It's gotta be love

Baby, how you do it
There must be somethin' to it
Babe I know it's gotta be love
{Oh, with magic in your hand}?
You made me understand
I know, I know it's gotta be love

It's gotta be love
(Love) and my life's lookin' up (love)",happy
Donna Summer,Bad Girls,"Bad girls
Talking about the sad girls
Sad girls
Talking about bad girls, yeah

See them out on the street at night, walkin'
Picking up on all kinds of strangers

You ask yourself who they are
Like everybody else
They come from near and far

Hey, Mister, have you got a dime
Mister, do you want to spent some time
Oh, yeah
I got what you want, you got what I need
I'll be your baby, come and spend it on me
Hey, Mister

John Cougar Mellencamp,Authority Song,"They like to get you in a compromising position
They like to get you there and smile in your face
They think, they're so cute when they got you in that condition
Well I think, it's a total disgrace
I fight authority, authority always wins

I been doing it, since I was a young kid
I've come out grinnin'
I fight authority, authority always wins
So I call up my preacher
I say:  Gimme strength for Round 5
He said:  You don't need no strength, you need to grow up, son
I said:  Growing up leads to growing old and then to dying,
And dying to me don't sound like all that much fun
I fight authority, authority always wins
I fight authority, authority always wins
I been doing it, since I was a young kid
I've come out grinnin'

The Motels,Only The Lonely,"We walked the loneliest mile
We smile without any style
We kiss all together wrong
No intention
We lie about each other's drinks
We live without each other
Thinking what anyone would do
Without me and you
It's like I told you
Only the lonely can play
So hold on here we go
Hold on to nothin' we know
I feel so lonely
Way up here
You mention the time we were together
So long ago well I don't remember
All I know is it makes me feel good now
It's like I told you only the lonely can play
Only the lonely only the lonely can play
Only the lonely only the lonely can play
It's like I told you only the lonely can play
Only the lonely
Only the lonely can play",sad
Edwin Starr,War,"War, huh, yeah
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
War, huh, yeah
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing
Say it again, why'all
War, huh, good god
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing, listen to me

'Cause it means destruction of innocent lives
War means tears to thousands of mothers eyes
When their sons go to fight
And lose their lives

Absolutely nothing say it again
War, whoa, lord
What is it good for
Absolutely nothing, listen to me

Made him disabled, bitter and mean
Life is much to short and precious
To spend fighting wars these days

It can only take it away

Andrew Gold,Lonely Boy,"He was born on a summer day 1951
And with a slap of a hand
He landed as an only son
His mother and father said what a lovely boy
We'll teach him what we learned
Ah yes just what we learned
We'll dress him up warmly and
We'll send him to school
It'll teach him how to fight
To be nobody's fool
Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
In the summer of '53 his mother
Brought him a sister
And she told him we must attend to her needs
She's so much younger than you
Well he ran down the hall and he cried
Oh how could his parents have lied
When they said he was an only son
He thought he was the only one
Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Goodbye mama, goodbye to you
Goodbye papa I'm pushing on through
He left home on a winter day 1969
And he hoped to find all the love
He had lost in that earlier time
Well his sister grew up
And she married a man
He gave her a son
Ah yes a lovely son
They dressed him up warmly
They sent him to school
It taught him how to fight
To be nobody's fool
Oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh, oh, oh, oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy
Oh what a lonely boy",sad
Madonna,Angel,"Why am I standing on a cloud
Every time you're around
And my sadness disappears
Every time you are near

[Bridge:]

You must be an angel
I can see it in your eyes
Full of wonder and surprise
And just now I realize

[Chorus:]

Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
Oooh you're an angel
In disguise, I can see it in your eyes

Walking down a crowded avenue
Other faces seem like nothing next to you
And I can't hear the traffic rushing by
Just the pounding of my heart and that's why

[bridge]
[chorus, repeat]

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel

Now I believe that dreams come true
'Cause you came when I wished for you
This just can't be coincidence
The only way that this makes sense is that

[chorus, repeat]

You're an angel
You're an angel, baby
You're an angel
You must be an angel, baby

Clouds just disappear",relaxed
