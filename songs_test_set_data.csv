20,Tarralyn Ramsey,Peace Of God,"Oh peace of God
Reign on me
My spirit's calling
To be free
My heart is heavy
I'm weighted down
For I know that your
Presence will always be around

Repeat 3 times

Ooh mmmmmm

For the peace of god
Surpasses all understanding
For the peace of God
Supasses all understanding",relaxed
143,Los Cadetes De Linares,Las Tres Tumbas,"Salieron de madrugada
Se oiha el canto de los
Gallos iban hacer 2 jornadas
Al lomo de sus caballos
La fiesta se celebraba en
El rancho del pitayo
Su padre les dio un consejo
Cuando apartir se aprestaban
Cuiden muy bien el peyejo
Por que la vida se acaba
En las palabras del viejo
Los 3 hermanos pensaban
Pedro le dice a fabian dale
Un trago a jose luis que beba
De ese mezcal pa que se
Seinta feliz que ahorita nomas
Al yegar nos vamos a divertir
Cuando arribaron al baile a
Bailar se dirigieron la muerte
Andaba en el aire eyos no la
Presintieron como les dijo su
Padre cuando del rancho salieron
Eran muchos los rivales viejos
Reencores surgieron rondando
Tras los jacales abrieron todos
El fuego asi matan los cobardes
Cuando los acosa el miedo
Un viejito solitario sin esperansa
Ninguna cuida el rancho y tres
Caballos como toda su fortuna
Va al panteon de ves en cuando
A visitar las 3 tumbas",sad
118,Red,Death Of Me,"I should have seen those signs all around me
But I was comfortable inside these wounds
So go ahead and take another piece of me, now
While we all bow down to you

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
And still it�s not enough
You try to tell me
You can heal me
But I�m still bleeding
And you�ll be the death of me

How can you end my affliction
If you�re the sickness and I�m the cure?
Too long I�ve faked this addiction
Another sacrifice to make us pure

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
And still it�s not enough
You try to tell me
You can heal me
But I�m still bleeding
And you�ll be the death of me

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
And still it�s not enough
You try to tell me
You can heal me
But I�m still bleeding
And you�ll be the death of me

I won�t forget
I cannot forget this
I won�t forget
I�ll never forget this
I won�t forget
I cannot forget this
I won�t forget
I�ll never forget this

I won�t forget
I cannot forget this
I won�t forget
I�ll never forget this
I won�t forget
I cannot forget this
I won�t forget
I�ll never forget

You know I can never prove this solution
You aren�t the one that I thought you were
And so I learn to embrace this illusion
The line that separates
It starts to blur

You tear me down
And then you pick me up
You take it all
And say it�s not enough
You try to tell me
You can heal me
But I�m still bleeding
And you�ll be the death of me
And you�ll be the death of me

I will not forget
I cannot forget this
And you�ll be the death of me",sad
123,Rage Against The Machine,Bombtrack,"Ughh!
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack...ughh!
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack...yeah!
It goes a-1, 2, 3...

Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack
And suckas be thinkin' that they can fade this
But I'm gonna drop it at a higher level
'Cause I'm inclined to stoop down
Hand out some beat-downs
Cold runna train on punk ho's that
Think they run the game

But I learned to burn that bridge and delete
Those who compete...at a level that's obsolete
Instead I warm my hands upon the flames of the flag
As I recall our downfall
And the business that burned us all
See through the news and the views that twist reality

Enough
I call the bluff
Fuck Manifest destiny

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

With the thoughts from a militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

It goes a-1, 2, 3
Another funky radical bombtrack
Started as a sketch in my notebook
And now dope hooks make punks take another look
My thoughts ya hear and ya begin to fear
That ya card will get pulled if ya interfere

With the thoughts from a militant militant mind
Hardline, hardline after hardline

Landlords and power whores
On my people they took turns
Dispute the suits I ignite
And then watch 'em burn

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn

Ughh
Hey yo, it's just another bombtrack
Yeah
Ughh

Check it out

Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn
Burn, burn, yes ya gonna burn

18,Jordin Sparks,Battlefield,"Don't try to explain your mind
I know what's happening here
One minute it's love and suddenly
It's like a battlefield
One word turns into a war
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down
My world's nothing when you're gone
I'm out here without a shield
Can't go back now

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing, oh, no
These times when we climb so fast to fall again
Why we gotta fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Why does love always feel like ...
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)
a battlefield (battlefield)
[repeat]
Why does love always feel like

Can't swallow our pride,
Neither of us wanna raise that flag
If we can't surrender
then we both gonna lose what we had, oh no

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing (nothing)
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again
I don't wanna fall for it now

I never meant to start a war
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

Why does love always feel like ...
a battlefield (battlefield)

Get your armor (get your armor)
I guess you better go and get your

We could pretend that we are friends tonight
And in the morning we'll wake up and we'll be alright
Cause baby we don't have to fight
And I don't want this love to feel like

A battlefield (oh), a battlefield (oh), a battlefield,
Why does love always feel like a battlefield (oh),
A battlefield (oh), a battlefield

I guess you better go and get your armor
I never meant to start a war (start a war)
You know I never wanna hurt you
Don't even know what we're fighting for

98,Bad Company,Feel Like Makin' Love,"Baby, when I think about you
I think about love
Darlin', don't live without you

If I had the sun and moon
And they were shinin'
I would give you both night and day
Of satisfyin'

43,Mudvayne,Scream With Me,"Ever feel like dying,
Ever feel alone,
Ever feel like crying,
Lost child in a store,
Ever feel life pushing,
Shoving you away,
Ever feel like breaking down,
Funeral in the rain

Feel like slipping away,
Stand in the corner and scream with me,
A body full of empty,
A head thats full of rage,
Better believe it,
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind thats like a fire,
Drivin by the pain,
Better believe it

Ever feel like lying,
Down inside a grave,
Listen to the eulegy,
A buyer of the hate,
Ever dance beside the devil,
Taste the barrel of a guage,
Ever pull the trigger,
The light begins to fade,

Feel like slipping away
Stand in the corner and scream with me,
A body full of empty,
A head thats full of rage,
Better believe it,
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind thats like a fire,
Drivin by the pain,
Better believe it

I've asked you for forgiveness,
I've asked you for your grace,
I've asked you for your blessing,
I've asked that I be saved,

Stand in the corner and scream with me,
A body full of empty,
A head thats full of rage,
Better believe it,

Stand in the corner and scream with me,
A body full of empty,
A head thats full of rage,
Better believe it,
Stand in the closet and scream with me
A mind thats like a fire,
Drivin by the pain,

97,Lynyrd Skynyrd,You Got That Right,"Well I've heard lots of people say
They're gonna settle down
You don't see their faces
And they don't come around
Well I'm not that way
I got to move along

I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right

Seems so long I been out on my own
Travel light and I'm always alone
Guess I was born with a travellin' bone
When my times up, I'll hold my own
You won't find me in an old folks home
You got that right
Well you got that right
Said, you got that right
Sure got that right
I tried everything in my life
Things I like I try 'em twice
You got that right
Sure got that right

Travellin' around the world, just singing my song
I got to go, Lord I can't stay long
Here comes that ol' travellin' jones once again
I like to drink and to dance all night
Comes to a fix not afraid to fight
You got that right
Said, you got that right
Well you got that right
Sure got that right

171,Aaron Shust,Give Me Words To Speak,"Calloused and bruised/ dazed and confused
My Spirit is left wanting something more
Than my selfish hopes/ and my selfish dreams
I'm lying with my face down to the floor
I'm crying out for more
Give me Words to speak
Don't let my Spirit sleep
'Cause I can't think of anything worth saying
But I know that I owe You my life
So give me Words to speak
Don't let my Spirit sleep
Every night, every day/ I find that I have nothing left to say
So I stand here in silence awaiting Your guidance
I'm wanting only Your voice to be heard
Let them be Your Words
I just don't understand this life that I've been living
I just don't understand (x2)
I just don't understand these lies I've been believing
I just don't understand (x2)",relaxed

Let it go on and on

Blow out that cherry bomb for me
We lost it long ago
You and me
Now you know your way back from the spirit far
Brush your teeth for bed
Blow out that cherry bomb
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
You got to know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve
Know it's on your sleeve (come on)
It was the longest day that I had ever known
I watched you start that drive alone
Blow out that cherry bomb for me
It's gonna burn right up your sleeve
Burn right up your sleeve
So there you go again
Out in your dressing gown
Get yourself to bed
Blow out that cherry bomb

I could pay to have all your cherry bomb
Oh, life can be so fair

85,Alice Cooper,No More Mr. Nice Guy,"I used to be such a sweet, sweet thing
'Til they got a hold of me.
I opened doors for little old ladies,
I helped the blind to see.
I got no friends 'cause they read the papers.
They can't be seen with me and I'm gettin' real shot down
And I'm feeling mean.

No more Mister Clean,

My dog bit me on the leg today.
My cat clawed my eyes.
Ma's been thrown out of the social circle,
And dad has to hide.
I went to church incognito.
When everybody rose, the Reverend Smith,
He recognized me,
And punched me in the nose, he said.
No more Mister Nice Guy,

54,Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"
 What we've got here is failure to communicate.
Some men you just can't reach...
So, you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it!
Well, he gets it!
N' I don't like it any more than you men.  *

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said,  Peace could last forever. ?
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
An' I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land

And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

 We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials,
For example, to create a vacuum.
Then we fill that vacuum as popular war advances.
Peace is closer.  **

I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
And I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
I don't need your civil war
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store

I don't need your civil war
I don't need one more war
