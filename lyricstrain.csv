Usher,There Goes My Baby,"There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out
When you be putting your heels on
I swear your body's so perfect baby
How you work it baby yea
I love the way that you be poking it out
Girl give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

I get the chills whenever I see your face
And you in the place girl
Feel like I'm in a movie baby
I'm like oowee baby oh
Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste girl
No need to keep this baby
I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

And girl I feel like it's our first time
Everytime we get together
Baby loving you feels better than
Everything, anything
Put on my heart you don't need a ring
And I promise our time away won't change my love

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

Girl, oh, I miss you
Baby, ever since that day you went away
I can't live without you
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind
If I don't see you today

With my white jacket on

Whitney Houston,My Love Is Your Love,"If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me

As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day

'Cause your love is my love
And my love is your love

Austra,Spellwork,"Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones or anything grown
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here
In evenings I work here
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left
All I adore...

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion
Spellwork and lies!

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire",angry
Coro,Can't Let You Go,"I should have known you'd be this way
Serves me right, to fall in love

You brought me love then you took it back
We had it all and that's a fact
Love is a game that we all play
There's one thing I've got to say
I gave you my heart and I gave you my world
I spent those lonley nights right here in the cold
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long

Chorus:
Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside
Repeat (1x)

I can't help but think of how you made me feel
Everytime I think of the two of us
Can't realize
Can't realize
Can't seem to buy it
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Chorus (2x)

Can't let you go my love
You fit me like a glove
'Cause when you hold me tight
The feelings oh so right
Just can't foget those times
When you were mine, all mine
This love I have for you is true
So come back to the one who loves you

Can't let you go...
Can't let you go...

Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long...

I should have known that you'd be this way
Serves me right to fall in love
I can't help but think how you left me feeling
Everytime I think about the two of us
Can't realize
Can't seem to buy it
Now that you're gone

New Direction,I Came To Jesus,"I was messed up, dirty as I could be,
I was on my way to hell
But I heard the preacher,
Preaching the Word of God,
Confess your sins and repent

I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, worn, and sad
I found in Him a resting place
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord,
�how could He love me,
I have sinned against Your will�
But He said, �repent and I will forgive you,
The question's who will you serve?�

You might be dirty, messed up inside,
You may even have lost your will to live
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel,
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me

Weary

And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself

Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key

Where is my motivation
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will

But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

 What we've got here is failure to communicate.
Some men you just can't reach...
So, you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it!
Well, he gets it!
N' I don't like it any more than you men.  *

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said,  Peace could last forever. ?
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
An' I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land

And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

 We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials,
For example, to create a vacuum.
Then we fill that vacuum as popular war advances.
Peace is closer.  **

Hail The Villain,Take Back The Fear,"What I believe is all that I am
Take it away, I'm only a man
Back from the dead and now it appears
I'll be the one to take back the fear

Kill or be killed, that isn't me
Maybe it's you dying to be
Somebody else. Man of the year
But I am the one to take back the fear

(chorus)
Don't want anything taken away
(Someone, anyone)
Taken away from me
It's all that I believe

Message of hate, fading away
My love and my failures  one in the same
Now that I'm back, painfully clear
But I'll be the one to take back the fear

When it seems that everything was all a dream
Everything's not what it seems
Even I cannot believe in me easily",angry

Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packing something and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell,

It's in again, we in the wind
Doing a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand,
40 oz in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs, yo
I gotta get the back streets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regard for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark,
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it popping, dog

Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Giving a damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling them,  We hate you.
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known

And heal me with a look

al otro lado del sol.

Ya no queda nada en el mundo
que nos haga dudarlo
para conservar el amor
es mejor marchar.

No nos hace falta la gente
ni vivir a su lado
tomame la mano
duerme y no lo pienses m�s.

Abriendo camino
vamonos de viaje
prepara el equipaje
no hay tiempo ya
y al despertar
la nueva luz
nos guiara
al mar azul.

Abriendo camino
date mucha prisa
que el soplo de la brisa
vendr� a buscar
y se llevar�
al amanecer
nuestro amor
al otro lado del sol.

Al otro lado del sol.",sad
Chalino Sanchez,Baraja De Oro ,"Voy a jugarme un albur
Con una baraja de oro
Que si la gano ya estuvo
Y si lo pierdo ni modo
Porque yo soy de los hombres que cuando pierdo no lloro.
Las mujeres son barajas
Ayy que saber barajar
Pa saber cual es la tuya
Es la que vas apostar
No ya despues de perdido
Quiran volver a jugar.
Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando lo sota de oros
Te aparece un caballero.
Disperce mi buen amigo
Es que yo llege primero.
El que no lo quier creer
Que le entre a lo pantera
Pierde dinero y mujer
Y hasta la portamoneda
A veces llega a su casa
Con la camisa de fuera.
Y nimodo de reclamos
Porque yo llege a caballo
Estoy regando el rosal pa cortar
La flor de Mayo.
Perdoneme rey de copas
Pero yo soy de a caballo.
Y si juegas sin malicia
Porque no les tienes miedo
Esperando a sota de oros
Te aparece un caballero
Dispense mi buen amigo
Es que yo llege primero.",sad

And anything my mama cooks

To be lived this way

And woman, every boy and girl

Here together in this world
Is love, love, love, love, love

Just to lay down and die

Let our hearts not forget

 Welcome home

In all his promises to carry on
He said,  I'll go prepare
A place for you

Sting,I Hung My Head,"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me  Why had I run
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
 Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find
I said  I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together 'til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head",sad

Open up your eyes and take a look around
Do you know where this love can be found?

'Cause I'm a full-grown woman
And I'm lookin' for a big love

I need love, gonna move this mountain
I need a love that I can't hide away
I need a love, gonna lift me up to that drinkin' fountain
Just like my daddy did in my younger days

Is this love gonna get up off the ground?
Is this love gonna get up off the ground?
I need a fifty-foot man to wrap these arms around
Is this love gonna get up off the ground?

'Cause I'm a full-grown woman
And I'm lookin' for a big love

Never did just a little drinkin'
I could drink the Milky Way
Think small and your heart starts shrinking
I'm here to stay

I got to have your big love
I've got to have it right away
Mmm, right away

I need a love as big as an ocean
I need a love that can't be crossed
I need love in perpetual motion
I need a love that won't get lost

Shelby Lynne,Family Tree,"I'm not happy with this conversation*
Too little righteous indignation
I'm not sure if I'm mad or mean
The tears I cry could mean anything

Just cause you're kin I let it slide
Insults and judgments I've been blind
And it hard for you to deal out digs
With a calloused heart your words are quick

I'm sick and tired of throwing stones
Cause all that leaves is broken bones
And I won't shed no blood for you
Aww the cuts too deep the bruise too blue

I've wasted time and been hand fed
You can't take back the things you said
Too much time has gone and passed
Shattered lives and broken glass

The pain is felt behind my eyes
But you won't see me through my disguise
Can't change fate cause this is done
Aww too late to start the race is run

Now's the time to face the facts
This train done slid right off the tracks
Regret is sad revenge is sweet
I'm walking on my own two feet

You could have come along but you broke my heart
Now's the time for me to start
Living my life without you
Being a rock in my shoe

Can't write the book cause this one's wrote
Time's a friend and love's a foe
The future's mine indeed it's grand
You ain't a part of my plan

When you lay down and think of me
There won't be much serenity
Just know that the aching in your brain
Is the sound of your soul's grief and pain

But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams
Would I love You enough to let go
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
If You're all You claim to be
Then I'm not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering
I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life
I give you my life
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
I want to be where You are
I'm running into Your arms
And I will never look back
