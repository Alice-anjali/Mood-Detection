Usher,There Goes My Baby,"There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

Bet you ain't know that I be checking you out
When you be putting your heels on
I swear your body's so perfect baby
How you work it baby yea
I love the way that you be poking it out
Girl give me something to feel on
So please believe we gone be twerking it out
By the end of the night baby

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

I get the chills whenever I see your face
And you in the place girl
Feel like I'm in a movie baby
I'm like oowee baby oh
Like waterfalls your hair falls down to your waist
Can I get a taste girl
No need to keep this baby
I ain't ashamed of calling your name girl

I've been waiting all day to wrap my hands
Around your waist and kiss your face
Wouldn't trade this feeling for nothing
Not even for a minute
And I'll sit here long as it takes
To get you all alone
But as soon as you come walking my way
You gon hear me say

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

And girl I feel like it's our first time
Everytime we get together
Baby loving you feels better than
Everything, anything
Put on my heart you don't need a ring
And I promise our time away won't change my love

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

There goes my baby
(oo girl look at you)
You don't know how good it feels to call you my girl
There goes my baby
Loving everything you do
Oo girl look at you

Girl, oh, I miss you
Baby, ever since that day you went away
I can't live without you
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind

You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
You're always on my mind
Girl, you're on my mind
If I don't see you today

With my white jacket on

Whitney Houston,My Love Is Your Love,"If tomorrow is judgment day
And I'm standing on the front line
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life
I will say I spent it with you

If I wake up in World War III
I see destruction and poverty
And I feel like I want to go home
It's okay if you're coming with me

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I lose my fame and fortune (really don't matter)
And I'm homeless on the street (on the street Lord)
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station (okay)
It's okay if you're sleeping with me

As the years they pass us by (the years, the years, the years, the years, the years)
We stay young through each other's eyes (each other's eyes)
And no matter how old we get
It's okay as long as I got you baby

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us
'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love
It would take an eternity to break us
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

If I should die this very day (very very very day)
Don't cry (don't cry), 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay
And no matter what the people say (really don't matter)
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day

'Cause your love is my love 
And my love is your love

Austra,Spellwork,"Habit alone, when separate I moan
Feeding on bones or anything grown
I command post and nobody shows
In mornings I rest here
In evenings I work here
My debt isn't spent till the rest of me's left
All I adore...

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

I work alone saving my soul
If yesterday hurts, tomorrow is worse
Send me a sign, for my body's aligned
I'm ready to waste all my limbs and my face
My pores are wide open
And bleed for your potion
Spellwork and lies!

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire

You must be the call
The evil at night
Speaking words of grace
While spellwork delights
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire
Feel my desire, it burns like a fire",angry
Coro,Can't Let You Go,"I should have known you'd be this way
Serves me right, to fall in love

You brought me love then you took it back
We had it all and that's a fact
Love is a game that we all play
There's one thing I've got to say
I gave you my heart and I gave you my world
I spent those lonley nights right here in the cold
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long

Chorus:
Can't let you go my love
It's you that I need
You keep me wanting you
You push my love aside
Repeat (1x)

I can't help but think of how you made me feel
Everytime I think of the two of us
Can't realize
Can't realize
Can't seem to buy it
Now that you're gone
Now that you're gone

Chorus (2x)

Can't let you go my love
You fit me like a glove
'Cause when you hold me tight
The feelings oh so right
Just can't foget those times
When you were mine, all mine
This love I have for you is true
So come back to the one who loves you

Can't let you go...
Can't let you go...

Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver
All I want to do is love you all night long...

I should have known that you'd be this way
Serves me right to fall in love
I can't help but think how you left me feeling
Everytime I think about the two of us
Can't realize
Can't seem to buy it

New Direction,I Came To Jesus,"I was messed up, dirty as I could be, 
I was on my way to hell
But I heard the preacher, 
Preaching the Word of God, 
Confess your sins and repent 

I came to Jesus as I was, 
Weary, worn, and sad 
I found in Him a resting place 
And He has made, made me glad

I asked the Lord, 
�how could He love me, 
I have sinned against Your will� 
But He said, �repent and I will forgive you, 
The question's who will you serve?� 

You might be dirty, messed up inside, 
You may even have lost your will to live
Don't be discouraged, don't throw in the towel, 
Confess your sins and repent so you can be like me 

Weary

Cut through me

Go, go, go
Pick up the pieces

See what's inside

Scares me

Look into my dirty mind

Take me away to paradise

And I smell like shit
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving
I sure as hell can't do it by myself
I'm feeling like a dog in heat
Barred indoors from the summer street
I locked the door to my own cell
And I lost the key
Bite my lip and close my eyes

Where is my motivation
No time for motivation
Smoking my inspiration
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling
Call me pathetic, call me what you will

But she don't like the one she's got
When masturbation's lost its fun
You're fucking lonely

And loneliness has to suffice

Was the keeping

Never ending pain, quickly ending life

[Chorus]
You keep this love, thing, love, child, love, toy
You keep this love, fist, love, scar, love, break
You keep this love

I'd been the tempting one
Stole her from herself
This gift in pain
Her pain was life
And sometimes I feel so sorry
I regret this the hurting of you
But you make me so unhappy
I'd take my life and leave love with you

I'd kill myself for you, I'd kill you for myself

Guns N' Roses,Civil War,"
 What we've got here is failure to communicate.
Some men you just can't reach...
So, you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it!
Well, he gets it!
N' I don't like it any more than you men.  *

Look at your young men fighting
Look at your women crying
Look at your young men dying
The way they've always done before

Look at the hate we're breeding
Look at the fear we're feeding
Look at the lives we're leading
The way we've always done before

My hands are tied
The billions shift from side to side
And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights
And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

D'you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said,  Peace could last forever. ?
And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
An' I went numb when I learned to see
So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fightin'
For their promised land

And
I don't need your civil war
It feeds the rich while it buries the poor
Your power hungry sellin' soldiers
In a human grocery store
Ain't that fresh
I don't need your civil war

Look at the shoes you're filling
Look at the blood we're spilling
Look at the world we're killing
The way we've always done before
Look in the doubt we've wallowed
Look at the leaders we've followed
Look at the lies we've swallowed
And I don't want to hear no more

My hands are tied
For all I've seen has changed my mind
But still the wars go on as the years go by
With no love of God or human rights
'Cause all these dreams are swept aside
By bloody hands of the hypnotized
Who carry the cross of homicide
And history bears the scars of our civil wars

 We practice selective annihilation of mayors and government officials,
For example, to create a vacuum.
Then we fill that vacuum as popular war advances.
Peace is closer.  **

And punched me in the nose, he said.

No more Mister Clean,
No more Mister Nice Guy,

You lie so much you believe yourself
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou
You are
Holier than thou
You are

You know not

Before you judge me take a look at you
Can't you find something better to do
Point the finger, slow to understand
Arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand

It's not who you are it's who you know
Others lives are the basis of your own
Burn your bridges build them back with wealth
Judge not lest ye be judged yourself

Holier than thou

Holier than thou

You know not

Yeah
Who the hell are you?

Hey you

Holier than thou

Holier than thou

Hail The Villain,Take Back The Fear,"What I believe is all that I am
Take it away, I'm only a man
Back from the dead and now it appears
I'll be the one to take back the fear

Kill or be killed, that isn't me
Maybe it's you dying to be
Somebody else. Man of the year
But I am the one to take back the fear

(chorus)
Don't want anything taken away
(Someone, anyone)
Taken away from me
It's all that I believe

Message of hate, fading away
My love and my failures  one in the same 
Now that I'm back, painfully clear
But I'll be the one to take back the fear

Everything's not what it seems

It's in again, we in the wind
Doing a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand,
40 oz in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs, yo
I gotta get the back streets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regard for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark,
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it popping, dog

Steady denying that it's racial profiling

Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Giving a damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling them,  We hate you. 
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known

To be lived this way

And woman, every boy and girl
That our only hope for living
Here together in this world
Is love, love, love, love, love
It's all about love, love, love, love, love

To know the love of our creator
And to give the love He's given us away

He says love love love

Let our hearts not forget

 Welcome home

In all his promises to carry on
He said,  I'll go prepare
A place for you

Sting,I Hung My Head,"Early one morning with time to kill
I borrowed Jeb's rifle and sat on the hill
I saw a lone rider crossing the plain
I drew a bread on him to practice my aim
My brother's rifle went off in my hand
A shot rang out across the land
The horse he kept running the rider was dead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
I set off running to wake from the dream
My brother's rifle went into the stream
I kept on running into the salt lands
And that's where they found me, my head in my hands
The sheriff he asked me  Why had I run 
Then it came to me just what I had done
And all for no reason, just one piece of lead
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
Here in the courthouse, the whole town is there
I see the judge high up in his chair
 Explain to the courtroom what went through your mind
And we'll ask the jury what verdict they find 
I said  I felt the power of death over life
I orphaned his children I widowed his wife
I beg their forgiveness I wish I was dead 
I hung my head, I hung my head
I hung my head, I hung my head
Early one morning with time to kill
I see the gallows up on the hill
And out in the distance a trick of the brain
I see a lone rider crossing the plain
He's come to fetch me to see what they done
We'll ride together 'til Kingdom come
I pray for God's mercy for soon I'll be dead

Shattered lives and broken glass

This train done slid right off the tracks
Regret is sad revenge is sweet
I'm walking on my own two feet

You could have come along but you broke my heart
Now's the time for me to start
Living my life without you
Being a rock in my shoe

Can't write the book cause this one's wrote
Time's a friend and love's a foe

Some day, some how, you'll see, you'll see

It can't compare to the joy that's coming

So hold on, you gotta wait for the light
Press on, and just fight the good fight
'Cause the pain that you've been feeling,
It's just the dark before the morning

My friend, you know how this all ends
And you know where you're going,
You just don't know how you get there
So say a prayer.
And hold on, cause there's good for those who love God,
Life is not a snapshot, it might take a little time,
But you'll see the bigger picture

Would you have stayed for me to tell you?

You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, go slow, I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering if I'm okay
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be waiting

Chromeo,Don't Turn The Lights On,"There must be another way 
When she's gone to a better place 
And loneliness will hurt you if you can't get through the night 
Then the moment starts to fade 
And dawn is just an hour away 
I feel she's watching over and it gets me through the night 

It makes me wonder what you'd say 
It's taking me back to the month of May 
When I watched you do it (all night) 
I'm thinking back to what we'd shared 
In many ways I'm already there 
And I watched you do it 

Don't turn the lights on 
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 
Don't turn the lights on 
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 
Don't turn the lights on 
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 
Don't turn the lights on 
Cause tonight I want to see you in the dark 

Another walk to take 
Another lonesome evening spent without you there 
And only those who hurt you 
Will say patience is a virtue 
And it's been so long 
And I can't think about it 
No, I can't figure it out 
'Cause just how real you're feeling 
Every time that you're appearing 
Leaves no room for doubt 

It makes me wonder what you'd say 
It's taking me back to the month of may 
When i watched you do it (all night)

You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams
You'll always be in my dreams
Never in my dreams
I thought I'd be with you
You're often on my mind
I'll always love you
When I close my eyes
Just to see your face
I wish this were real
But I'm just dreaming
I can't believe that
This is all in a dream
I'm gonna wait to be
With you my love
I'll always love you
And want you more
I can't go on
Without your love

And other things that go bump in the night
'Cause to me everyday is Halloween
I have given up hiding and started to fight
I have started to fight
Well any time, any place, anywhere that I go
All the people seem to stop and stare
They say  why are you dressed like it's Halloween?
You look so absurd, you look so obscene 
Oh, why can't I live a life for me?
Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me
It's the same, it's the same in the whole wide world
Well I let their teeny minds think
That they're dealing with someone who is over the brink
And I dress this way just to keep them at bay

Why should I take the abuse that's served?

Why should I take the abuse that's served?
Why can't they see they're just like me

Why hide it why fight it?

You came waltzing over to me
And Your eyes they saw right through me
And You heard each one of my cries for help
And You came to rescue me

Every prayer that I had spoken
Reached Your ears and all my tears weren't cried in vain
You carried all my pain
And put me back together again
You watch over me in the darkest valleys
You watch over me when the night seems long
You help me to see the way before me
You watch over me; You watch over me
Always faithful
To be leading, at this moment
Interceding for Your children
Though I've wandered astray from Your infinite ways
You've never left me alone -[to chorus]

Never once have You forsaken me
Even though I walk through this shadow of death
You will guide and defend me
You'll guard and protect me
Even though I walk through this shadow of death
You will lead me home",sad

Phil Collins,Another Day In Paradise,"She calls out to the man on the street
'Sir, can you help me?
It's cold and I've nowhere to sleep,
Is there somewhere you can tell me?'
He walks on, doesn't look back
He pretends he can't hear her
Starts to whistle as he crosses the street
Seems embarrassed to be there
Oh think twice, it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice, 'cause it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise, think about it
She calls out to the man on the street
He can see she's been crying
She's got blisters on the soles of her feet
She can't walk but she's trying
Oh think twice, 'cause it's another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise, think about it
Oh Lord, is there nothing more anybody can do
Oh Lord, there must be something you can say
You can tell from the lines on her face
You can see that she's been there
Probably been moved on from every place
Cause she didn't fit in there
Oh think twice, 'cause another day for you and me in paradise
Oh think twice, it's just another day for you,
You and me in paradise, just think about it, think about it

Spent my nights awake and I wondered
What I could have done in another way

I will end up lost in confusion

Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
'Cause your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

You used to captivate me by your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face, it haunts my once pleasant dreams
Your voice, it chased away all the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years

Tonic,You Wanted More,"Love is tragic, love is bold
You will always do what you are told
Love is hard, love is strong
You will never say that you were wrong

I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

Love is color, love is loud
Love is never saying you're too proud
Love is trusting, love is honest
Love is not a hand that holds you down

I don't know when I got bitter
But love is surely better when it's gone

'Cause you wanted more
More than I could give
More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer
For a love that isn't there

I got to get my feet back on the ground
I got to pick me up when I am down

But love is surely better when it's gone

More than I could handle
In a life that I can't live
You wanted more
More than I could bear
More than I could offer

And wouldn't it be nice to live together

You know it's gonna make it that much better
When we can say goodnight and stay together

Wouldn't it be nice if we could wake up
In the morning when the day is new
And after having spent the day together
Hold each other close the whole night through

Happy times together we've been spending
I wish that every kiss was neverending
Wouldn't it be nice

Maybe if we think and wish and hope and pray it might come true
Baby then there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
We could be married (we could be married)
And then we'd be happy (and then we'd be happy)

Wouldn't it be nice

You know it seems the more we talk about it
It only makes it worse to live without it
But lets talk about it
Wouldn't it be nice

To each evening when the lights are low
To underscore our love affair with tenderness and feelings

A bond that was never torn apart

And his devotion is still going strong

A devil when she held me close, an angel when she smiled.

She's go away when the grass turned green and the sky turned baby blue.

And baby blue was the color of her eyes.
Baby blue like the Colorado skies.
Like a breath of spring, she came and left,
And I still don't know why,
So here's to you and whoever holds my baby blue tonight.

She brought colors to my life that my eyes had never touched.

Yes they've all come to meet me arms areaching smiling sweetly
It's so good to touch the green green grass of home
The old house is still standing though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
And down the lane I'd walk with my sweet Mary hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green green grass of home
Yes they've all come to meet me arms areaching smiling sweetly
Lord it's so good to touch the green green grass of home

And I realized that I was only dreaming
For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre arm in arm we'll walk at daybreak
Once again I'll touch the green green grass of home
Yes they'll all come to see me in the shade of that old oak tree
As they lay me neath the green green grass of home",relaxed

Ever since the days of old,
Men would search for wealth untold.
They'd dig for silver and for gold, 
And leave the empty holes.
And way down south in the Everglades,
Where the black water rolls and the saw grass sways.
The eagles fly and the otters play,
In the land of the Seminole. 

So blow, blow Seminole wind,
Blow like you're never gonna blow again.
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend
But I know who you are.
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee,
All the way up to Micanopy.
Blow across the home of the Seminole,
The alligators and the gar.

Progress came and took its toll,
And in the name of flood control,
They made their plans and they drained the land,
Now the glades are going dry.
And the last time I walked in the swamp,
I sat upon a Cypress stump,
I listened close and I heard the ghost,
Of Osceola cry.

So blow, blow Seminole wind,
Blow like you're never gonna blow again.
I'm calling to you like a long lost friend
But I know who you are.
And blow, blow from the Okeechobee,
All the way up to Micanopy.

When an airplane flies without any fuel
And sunlight heats our home

And the sun come shining through

Well it changed my thinking when you changed your name,
And neither one of us will ever be the same,
And I swear I'm never gonna be untrue, 
Cause I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you.

If I didn't have you,
I'd long ago been left in the dark out in the cold,
Blowing around from town to town, 
Like a feather in the wind.
If I didn't have you I know I'd be, 
Floundering around like a ship at sea,
Lost in the rain on a hurricane and that's where I'd have been,
But I didn't get lost cause I saw your light, 
Shining like a beacon on a cold dark night.
And the sun came up and the skies turned blue,
No, I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you.

Well I count my blessings every night I pray,
That the lord lets me keep you just one more day,
And every day he does,
Cause god knows too, 
That I wouldn't have nothing if I didn't have you.

When hearts like ours meet.

The shadow in the background of the morgue.

Comes creeping on so haunting every time.

The webs from all the spiders
Catching things and eating their insides.

And hear your voice of treason.
Will you come home and stop this pain tonight?
Stop this pain tonight.

There's a silence here between us
I've never heard before
And I can't find the love
In her eyes anymore
There's some changes going on
I'm beginning to understand
When I'm holding her
I swear I feel the presence of another man

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

She sits staring out the window
A million miles away
And when I ask if she's all right
She never has too much to say
Is it somebody we both know
Or somebody she just met
Is she loving him in her mind
While she's lying here in my bed

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away from me

Suspicions lead to questions
And questions to alibis
Is it just my imagination
Or has her love turned into lies

There's a stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see
Stranger in my house
Somebody here trying to take her away
Stranger in my house
Somebody's here that I can't see

I'll think of you each step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you
Bitter-sweet memories
That's all I am taking with me
Good-bye, please don't cry
We both know that I'm not
What you need
I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life, treats you kind
And I hope that you have all
That you ever dreamed of
And I wish you joy
And happiness
But above all of this
I wish you love
And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

Emmylou Harris,Queen Of The Silver Dollar,"She arrives in all her splendor
Each night at nine o'clock
Her chariot is the crosstown bus
That stops right down the block
Now the old piano minstrel plays her tune as she walks in
And the Queen of the Silver Dollar's home again

She's the Queen of the Silver Dollar
She rules this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is her throne
Now the jesters flock around her tryna to win her favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Now her royal dress is satin
It's shabby and it's torn
The royal jewels are rhinestones
The shoes are scuffed and worn
Of the many roads she's been down,
And the places that she's seen
Well they all look at her and say God save the queen

Now the Queen of the Silver Dollar
Is not as haughty as she seems
She was once an ordinary girl with ordinary dreams
But there's a man who found her
And he brought her to this world
He's the one who made a queen of a simple country girl

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Yes I'm the Queen of the Silver Dollar
I rule this smokey kingdom
Scepter is a wine glass and a bar stool is my throne
Now the jesters flock around me tryin' to win my favors
To see which one will take the
Queen of the Silver Dollar home

Good to see you again

Charley Pride,Kiss An Angel Good Mornin',"
Whenever I chance to meet some old friends on the street
They wonder how does a man get to be this way
I've always got a smilin' face any time and any place
And everytime they ask me why I just smile and say
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'
And let her know you think about her when you're gone
Kiss an angel good mornin' and love her like a devil when you get back home

Well people may try to guess the secret of happiness
But some of them never learn it's a simple thing
The secret I'm speaking of is a woman and a man in love
And the answer is in the song that I always sing
You've got to kiss an angel good mornin'...
Kiss an angel good mornin'...

The Judds,Love Can Build A Bridge,"
I'd gladly walk across the desert
With no shoes upon my feet
To share with you the last bite
Of bread I had to eat
I would swim out to save you
In your sea of broken dreams
When all your hopes are sinkin'
Let me show you what love means

[Chorus]
Love can build a bridge
Between your heart and mine
Love can build a bridge
Don't you think it's time?
Don't you think it's time?

I would whisper love so loudly
Every heart could understand
That love and only love
Can join the tribes of man
I would give my heart's desire
So that you might see
The first step is to realize
That it all begins with you and me

[Repeat Chorus]

When we stand together
It's our finest hour
We can do anything, anything
Keep believin' in the power

True, not another minute on this Earth can be borrowed,
So there's no way to know when I'll live my last tomorrow

Promoter's in the pay box wondering where the band's gone
Back in the pub the governor stops the clock

Scorpions,Coming Home,"Every morning when I wake up yawning
I'm still far away
Trucks still rolling through the early morning
To the place we play
Boy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you know
The tour's still far away
Boy you're home, you're dreaming, don't you know
You're having just a break
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
Dream we're going out on stage, it feels like
Coming home again
It's great to be here to see you all
I know, for me it is like
Coming home
Day after day out on the road
There's no place too far that we wouldn't go
We go wherever you like
To rock 'n' roll
Jump on the seats, put your hands in the air
Give me a shout, let me hear you're out there
The wilder you scream for some more rock 'n' roll
The higher we'll go
Year after year out on the road
It's great to be here to rock you all
I know, for me it is like
Coming home
Like coming home",relaxed

Rihanna,Russian Roulette,"Take a breath, take it deep
Calm yourself, he says to me
If you play, you play the key
Take the gun, and count to three
I'm sweating now, I'm moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go
And you can see my heart, beating,
You can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger (trigger, trigger, trigger)
Say a prayer, to yourself
He says, close your eyes
Sometimes it helps
And then I get, a scary thought
That he's here, means he's never lost
And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
As my life flashes before my eyes
I'm wondering will I, ever see another sunrise?
So many won't get the chance to say goodbye
But it's too late to think of the value of my life
And you can see my heart, beating,
Now you can see it through my chest
Said I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!

Oh you can see it through my chest
I'm terrified but I'm not leaving, no!

Shania Twain,From This Moment On,"I just swear
That I'll aways be there
I give anything
And everything
And I will always care
Through weakness and strength
Happiness and sorrow
For better, for worse
I will love you
With every beat of my heart
From this moment life has begun
From this moment you are the one
Right beside you is where I belong
From this moment on
From this moment, I have been blessed
I live only, for your happiness
And for your love, I give my last breath
From this moment on
I give my hand to you with all my heart
I can't wait to live my life with you I can't wait to start
You and I will never be apart
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing, I wouldn't give
From this moment on
You're the reason I believe in love
And you're the answer to my prayers from up above
All we need is just the two of us
My dreams came true because of you
From this moment, as long as I live
I will love you, I promise you this
There is nothing, I wouldn't give
From this moment, I will love you
As long as I live from this moment on",relaxed
Julio Iglesias,My Love,"My love is warmer than a smile 
My love gives to every needing child 
If anyone should ask you who's my true love 
Tell them my love true is ever letting all their love come through 

My love sees love with not a face 
And lives to love through time and space 
If all of everything about my love fits to the tune of you 
Then you can say that you are my love too 

Let my love shine throughout the world 
To every mountain top and steeple 
Let it be felt by every soul 
'Til love's all over 
Let it reach out to every heart 
To every disenfranchised people 
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over 

Our love sees love's the key to peace 
We'll pray 'til all world wars have ceased 
Should you or anyone you know enough to say they feel as we 
Then let our universal song be free 

Let our love shine throughout the world 
To every mountain top and steeple 
Let it be felt by every soul 
'Til love's all over 
Let it reach out to every heart 
To every disenfranchised people 
'Til it is present and no more is pain all over 

Say words of love to all we see 
To rich or poor for love is equal 
Let us lift up humanity 
Spread love all over 
Let all its forces join as one 
So to rebuke all signs of evil 
Through every valley, land and sea 
Our love's all people

Mean we're never alone, 
Never alone, no, no

Come on, come on

Come on, come on

I'm here with you

While an old Love song is creeping into your head
And as your eyes just closed I could only guess
If you were dreaming of me again

Stained glass casts a flickering light
With the curtains closed I can't tell if it's night
But I know for sure that this sure feels right
With you here between my arms I want to stay with you, baby
Won't you let me stay?
You're a Beautiful Girl

I'm just a jealous guy
I was feeling insecure you might not love me anymore

Get out of this house 
I got more than I need, more than I ever could use 
Get out of this house
I spent seventeen years trying to save my soul 
I spent twenty three more down in the hole 
Now my soul is alright but I might get found out 
I got myself this house now and I can't get out
If I see you again it will be in my head at the end of a cloud 
If you see me again it will be in your head telling you to get out
You act like a baby, you talk like a fool 
Get out of this house

Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done
What it's doing to me

Love makes strange enemies
Makes love where love may please
Soul and its striptease
Hate brought to its knees

The sky over our head
You can reach it from our bed
If you let me in your heart
And out of my head

Oh can't you see what our love has done
Oh can't you see what our love has done

And to love I rhapsodize

Oh can't you see what our love has done
To every broken heart

For every heart it cries
Oh can't you see what our love has done
Love left a window in the skies
What it's doing to me

Sidewalk Prophets,You Can Have Me,"If I saw You on the street
And You said come and follow me
But I had to give up everything
All I once held dear and all of my dreams
Would I love You enough to let go
Or would my love run dry
When You asked for my life
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
If You're all You claim to be
Then I'm not losing anything
So I will crawl upon my knees
Just to know the joy of suffering
I will love You enough to let go
Lord, I give you my life
I give you my life
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
I want to be where You are
I'm running into Your arms
And I will never look back
So Jesus, here is my heart
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me
Father of love, You can have me
You can have me
When did love become unmoving?
When did love become unconsuming?
Forgetting what the world has told me

Josh Wilson,Before The Morning,"Do you wonder why you have to feel the things that hurt you
If there's a God who loves you, where is He now
Maybe there are things you can't see
And all those things are happening to bring a better ending
Someday somehow you'll see, you'll see
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still have a reason to sing
Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming
So hold on you gotta wait for the light
Press on and just fight the good fight
Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It's just the dark before the morning
My friend, you know how this all ends, you know where you're going
You just don't know how you'll get there, so say a prayer
And hold on cause there's good for those who love God
But life is not a snapshot, it might take a little time
But you'll see the bigger picture
Once you feel the weight of glory
All your pain will fade to memory
Once you feel the weight of glory
All your pain will fade to memory
Would you dare, would you dare to believe
That you still got a reason to sing
Cause the pain that you've been feeling
It can't compare to the joy that's coming

Almost left behind
Suitcases of memories

Sometimes you picture me 
And I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, and I can't hear
What you've said
Then you say go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting
Time after
My picture fades and darkness has
Turned to gray
Watching through windows you're wondering
If I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
If you're lost you can look, you will find me
Time after time
If you fall I will catch you I'll be waiting

Is it just me or is everyone
Hiding out between the lines
What will we be when we come undone
Just a simple meeting of the minds?
And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
Underneath your skies
There's a million lights
Burning brightly just like fireflies
It's cold and heaven surrounds you from every direction
Cause there's someone behind every hand
That you've made a connection
And now we're free to be number one
The morning isn't far away
I had a dream we were holding on
And tomorrow has become today, become today
And we'll fight fire with fire
Fire with fire
Fire with fire
Through desire, desire -sire, desire
Through your desire
We'll fight fire with fire

All you have to do is touch my hand
To show me you understand
And something happens to me

Any time my little world is blue
I just have to look at you
And every thing seems to be some kind of wonderful

There's so much I wanna say
But the right words just don't come my way
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And something happens to me

J. Moss,Abundantly,"It would be like the sky that's never sunny
It would be like the bee that can't make honey
Or maybe like the fallin snow that never melts
Like always hearing of your touch but never felt
It's like the vase that holds no flowers

[Chorus:]
Never wanna sleep with out you
Never wanna wake with out you
I never wanna part with life abundantly

Never take a chance with out you
(Cause) I'll never do my best with out you
I never wanna leave this life abundantly

Hallelujah

[Verse 2:]
It would be like the game that has no winner
Like knowing loves behind the door you cannot enter
Like knowing joys in a mornin that never comes
(Kinda like) What life would be if God didn't send his son
It's kinda like a heart with no love flowing through it

[Chorus:]
(I) Never wanna sleep with out you
(And I) Never wanna wake with out you
(No) I never wanna part with life abundantly

Never take a chance with out you
(Cause) I never do my best with out you
(Oh Father) I never wanna leave this life abundantly

[Chorus:]
Never wanna sleep with out you
Never wanna wake with out you
I never wanna part with life abundantly

Never take a chance with out you
(Cause) I never do my best with out you
I never wanna leave this life abundantly

Since you came in my life your source of my abundant living

Go on and tell me lies but hold me tight.
Save your goodbyes for the morning light (morning light),
But dont let me be lonely tonight.
I dont want to be lonely tonight.
No, no, I dont want to be lonely tonight.

I dont want to be lonely tonight.

Kindred The Family Soul,House Of Love,"Every time I think about where we were and where we are
Something that's unbelievable
We been building on the slow but to see it come together
It's like a dream's achievable

We had bumps along the way, quite a few surprises
But we held fast, dealt with all the compromises
Put our pride aside how we sacrifice so long
For something we could call our own

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

I used to think of all the things we've overcome
As just our history
But now I know that all the things we built together
Will be our legacy

The world will know that we were here
Our intent to stay sincere, our purpose and hearts were clear
Our babies will have babies of their own
And our love will live on for generations to come Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

Every single brick and every single nail
Every single triumph and every single fail
'Cause the house of love that we live in
I know it's from the ground 'cause we built it

This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

Every step, solid rock as a foundation
And a roof made of hope for our protection
A room of opportunity driven by affection

And every room I put my heart
And if these walls they could talk
They would keep you up all night
Telling you the first day
We moved to our biggest fight

Make so many memories
So here's and extra set of keys
Love made it whicha share it
Whicha right here in this house This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love
This house, this house, this house
We built a house of love

My skin soaking wet
My eyes searched for you
It seems you lost your way
You've let it all fall apart
Nothing's left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we've lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me
With sharpened tongue
I cried out for you
And must I refrain
Now that I need you
The autumn wind feels
As if it were you
And swayed through the fields
Where I once held you
It seems you lost your way
You've let it all fall apart
Nothing's left here but you
All you do is remind me
Now that we've lost our way
The rest can all fall apart
All I see here is you
All it does is remind me
Whistle through your window
We act the same as you
Whistle through your window
We act the same as you",sad

Dividing in
That I couldn't abide
I wouldn't miss it again
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost

But made it die
Pushed out of the way
She said please stay
Burning every bridge that I cross
To find some beautiful place to get lost
To find some beautiful place to get lost
I don't know where I'll go now
And I don't really care who follows me there
But ill burn every bridge that I cross

Can't name 'em cause they shook
Took over some wit-protect

Fuck around with B'more

Fuck grammar, ill-mannered

Stretch the height
You might want to stay on your toes to
Secure a full view
For skewed vision conditions lead you to assume
And while you assume
I'm feeling uneasy
My patterns are broken
Shared my thoughts but my guts don't even believe me
Sleep don't relieve me, it's like doom conceived me
Got a whole lot of something, yet I constantly feel
Like nothing much, just your average such and such
So much acclaimed moving
But nigga I'm really touched

If you didn't pull me back, spitting on his new shoes)

Yes, you too can get fucked up)

Lives a life that isn't necessarily sunny

Is the kind that is for girl and boys meant
Fall in love you won't regret it
That''s the best work of all if you can get it

'Neath the starry sky
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Scrolling with the one girl
Sighing after sigh
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if you try
Just imagine someone waiting at the cottage door
Where two hearts become one
Who could ask for more
Loving one who loves you
And taking that vow
Nice work if you can get it
And you can get it if

This love will last though years may go

We were not too young at all

And with freedom as the doctrine, guess who was the new authority?

How to turn down the noise in my mind
Now I haven't got time for the pain
I haven't got room for the pain
I haven't the need for the pain
Not since I've known you
Suffering was the only thing that made me feel I was alive
Though that's just how much it cost to survive in this world
'til you showed me how, how to fill my heart with love
How to open up and drink in all that white light
Pouring down from the heaven

Somehow deserve what I already have
I need you to love me
Your love makes me forget what I have been
Your love makes me see who I really am
Your love makes me forget what I have been
But I need you to love me, and I
I won't keep my heart from you this time
So I'll stop this pretending that I can
Somehow deserve what I already have
I need you to love me",happy
John Prine,Glory Of True Love,"Oh, the glory of true love
Is a wild and precious thing
It don't grow on old magnolias
Or only blossom in the spring
No, the glory of true love
Is it will last your whole life through
Never will go out of fashion
Always will look good on you
You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But old faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love
Long before I met you, darlin'
Lord, I thought I had it all
I could have my lunch in London
And my dinner in St. Paul
I got some friends in Albuquerque
Where the governor calls me  Gov 
You can give 'em all to goodwill
For the glory of true love
You can climb the highest mountain
Touch the moon and stars above
But old faithful's just a fountain
Compared to the glory of true love
Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true love
Glory, glory, glory, glory
You can't never get enough
Time alone will tell the story
Of the glory of true love",happy
Luciano,For The Leaders,"This is my appeal
To all your leaders out there, to stop the war
Cuz theres no justifiable reason
It's about time that you realize that your not fulfilling your true purpose

[Chorus]
This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world
This one's for the leaders, who are fighting war
All over the world

[Verse 1]
Think about the yutes, who are dyng out, (dying out)
Crying out (crying out) for love
Victims of the system, we divide and grow
To break us down, and tear us apart
What is the future of the human race
How will the children grow to take our place
Where is the love that we should all embrace
I do believe it's here, for you and me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
This one is for, the leaders who are fighting war
All over the world
Imagine all the money, that you spend on arms
Guns and bombs, to destroy
While people are left hungry, to die from wants
And those who do survive are unemployed
What is the future of the human race
How will the children grow to take our place
Where is the love that we should all embrace
I do believe, it here for you and me",angry

Theory Of A Deadman,Hate My Life,"So sick of the hobos
Always beggin' for change

Nice guys always lose
How could she have another headache?
There's always some kind of excuse
I still hate my job
My boss is a dick

When a girl's underage
And how when I tell her she's a nice piece of ass
Then her daddy punches me in the face

Bitches here's what you've gotta do
Put your middle fingers up in the air
Go on and say  fuck you

Can you feel my trigger hand, moving further down your back
When you hide, hide inside that body
But just remember that when I touch you
The more you shake, the more you give away
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, �cause I'm so blind, say never
We're far from comfortable this time
Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never
We're far from obvious this time
Wait, another minute here, time will kill us after all
Now can you feel its second hand wrapped around your neck
So fall into my eyes and fall into my lies
But don't you forget
The more you turn away, the more I want you to stay
Cold, but I'm still here, blind, �cause I'm so blind, say never

Cold, now we're so cold, mine, and you're not mine, say never

Alabama,Down Home,"Just off of the beaten path
A little dot on a state road map
That's where I was born and where I'll die
Things move at a slower pace
Nobody's in the rat race
And these days that's a special way of life
Down home, where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake are all you need
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
In the corner of the hardware store
Gathered 'round a checkerboard
Old men telling lies and crowning kings
Kids driving 'round the old town square
Tops rolled down in the cool night air
Go and see what's shaking at the Dairy Queen
Down home, where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake are all you need
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
When I was a boy, I couldn't wait to leave this place
But now I wanna see my children raised down home
Down home
Folks know if they're falling on hard times
They can fall back on
Those of us raised up down home
Where they know you by name and treat you like family
Down home, a man's good word and hand shake are all you need

Sometimes I'd like to hide away somewhere and lock the door
A single battle lost but not the war

It's almost like the hard times circle 'round
A couple drops and they all start coming down
Yeah, I might feel defeated,
And I might hang my head
I might be barely breathing, but I'm not dead
Tomorrow's another day
And I'm thirsty anyway
So bring on the rain
No I'm not gonna let it get me down
I'm not gonna cry
And I'm not gonna lose any sleep tonight

Wicked cancer grows beneath the surface

The only chance my kin survives

Cast into the landscape searching for his...retribution

Bow down to your master
